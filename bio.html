			<h5>About</h5>
			<p>Welcome to my About page where you get to learn a little more about me! I am
    	a Professional Writing (PW) major. I came from a town whose high school was called
		Pewamo-Westphalia (PW). So when my college advisor asked me why I wanted to be a 
		PW major I obviously felt it was meant to be (but not really), let's rewind a bit. Ever
		since I was little I have loved to read. I begged my mom to teach me to read and I loved 
		reading to my classmates and aunts and uncles. You can imagine my mother was a bit
		enthused and vexed when I made a long distance phone call to Texas (back when landlines
		were the most popular form of communication) just to read a story to my aunt. Sometime
		in early elementary school I started to write my own stories. In sixth grade I had my 
		own short story published, which was exciting. I have a deep desire to write books 
		that takes one on an adventure.
		</p>
		<p>Aside from reading and writing, I enjoy many other things. Things like working (who knew?)
		and having down time with my friends. I really enjoy my job that I have right now
		as a student employee at the IPF (Infrastructure Planning & Facilities Building) 
		on campus. If I could work more than 40 hours a week all of the time I probably would.
		I think I should be concerned that I might turn out to be a workaholic. I am also 
		very sarcastic, so be prepared, and I like to keep people guessing. Maybe the latter
		will really help me out with my writing.</p>
		<p>Now you have seen a bit of my formal and informal side. If you have any questions
		or want to know more, feel free to e-mail me at my gmail or contact me through 
		my Linkedin account. Thanks for reading!</p>
