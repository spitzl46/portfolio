			<li>This is a fictional story that I wrote for a contest. Children's stories that won
			were put into the Anthology of Short Stories by Young Americans. This story was approved
			and published in the 2007 edition.</li>
			<li>My very first year of college I took an Integrated Arts & Humanities class. One of the
			main things I learned about my writing from my professor was that I needed to pick one idea,
			stay focused on that idea.This piece I feel exemplifies the things I learned in
			her class.</li> 
			<li>Also my first year of college I took an English class. In that class I learned how to
			analyse texts, form an opinion on my analysis, and prove my opinion with textual
			evidence. This is one of my favorite pieces I did for this class.</li>
