		<h3>Welcome!</h3>
		<body>Hey! You have stumbled across my site; my PW Portfolio. 
		Everything I have learned thus far in my major is condensed into a few pieces to
		highlight what I have learned and how I have grown in my writing. You will find a 
		page with my written works that shows the different genres I have learned an an
		improvement in my ability to analyse a text and back up my findings with textual 
		evidence, among other things. There is also a page about my activities outside my 
		major called "Extracurricular", one about myself on a more personal level called 
		"Bio", and a page with my resume and cover letter called "Resume". Feel free to poke
		around and check out my site. I hope you find something that interests you and piques
		your curiosity!</body>
